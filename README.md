# 🌿 Minimal Peil

A quiet space for exploring minimalism and permaculture  
— through words, reflection, and small everyday experiments.

This blog is part of my personal project:  
[Minimal Peil](https://minimal-peil.github.io)

Written and maintained by **いっぺい (Ippei)** –  
living simply, staying grounded, and sharing what grows from that soil.
